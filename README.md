Iâ€™m David, better known by my nickname on social networks "Sasuke", I am currently a freelancer who works with bots for Discord and websites made with react.js, express or just HTML, CSS and JS.

I am currently doing very well with the typescript and javascript languages, and have been doing a lot of projects using node.js, if you are looking for a developer for your project, contact me at Discord: Sasuke#7256.
